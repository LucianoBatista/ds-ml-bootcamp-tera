# Git-Flow

- Main branch: don't touch
- Develop branch: where you'll develop your code. When we need develop new features, we bifurcate from the develop that needs to be always updated like the main.
- hot-fixes, bug-fixes, features...: are other branches that we can use on git-flow workflow.


# Git basic commands

- status: `git status -s`
- branch: `git branch`
- add: `git add document.py`
- commit: `git commit -am "message"`
- push: `git push`
- pull: `git pull`
- checkout: `git checkout -b new-feature/qrcode`
- merge: `git merge new-feature/qrcode`

# PRs

Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. In a shared repo model, PRs helps on code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the main branch.
